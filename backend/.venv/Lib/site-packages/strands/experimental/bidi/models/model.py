"""Bidirectional streaming model interface.

Defines the abstract interface for models that support real-time bidirectional
communication with persistent connections. Unlike traditional request-response
models, bidirectional models maintain an open connection for streaming audio,
text, and tool interactions.

Features:

- Persistent connection management with connect/close lifecycle
- Real-time bidirectional communication (send and receive simultaneously)
- Provider-agnostic event normalization
- Support for audio, text, image, and tool result streaming
